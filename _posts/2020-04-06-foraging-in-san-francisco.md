Walden. Fuck the wilderness - im a city boy




I live in Bernal Heights, a small neighborhood on a hill. From my apartment you can see a panorama of San Francisco: from the Golden Gate Bridge to the Bay Bridge, with Mid-Market and the Mission in between. On Friday I went for a walk. This blog post is about the plants I collected and ate along the way.

### Loquat

_Eriobotrya japonica_

I put on a light jacket, a scarf, and sunglasses. San Francisco is often described as a city of "eternal spring," but this is only part of the story: San Francisco is a superimposition of every season: spring mornings, summer afternoons, autumn in the valleys, winter on wind-swept hilltops. After walking down the flight of steps and crossing the street I'm already warm enough to remove my scarf.

Overhanging a chest-high wooden fence is a short tree with broad waxy leaves and bunches of stout, teardrop-shaped fruits. These fruits are loquats, and are the size and color of egg yolks. I grab a few and peel them as I walk. Loquats have a mild pear-like taste and a texture like flan. Inside are two to three large black seeds that look like glazed black marbles. I chew the fruit from around the seeds and throw the pits on the ground.

### Plum

_Prunus cerasifera_

A few houses down I encounter a tall-ish tree with dark, wine-colored leaves. This is the _krauter vesuvius_ cultivar of the cherry plum tree. Some of the higher branches have small bunches of fruits, which, eponymously, look like a cross between a plum and a cherry. Luckily I'm tall, so I'm able to collect several handfulls. These fruits are usually too tart to eat directly (unless they extremely ripe to the point of almost rotting), so I bring them home to cook into jam. Cherry plum jam is very simple: pitted fruits, sugar and water are boiled on low heat until the jam begins to congeal; let it cool off and fill up mason jars.

### Artichoke

### Fennel

### Blackberry

### Strawberry Tree

### Miner's Lettuce



### Sorrel

 walked around my neighborhood collecting and eating the edible plants that I came across.









Imagine a global pandemic that wipes out most of the human race. Governments collapse. Power stations fail. Supply lines are disrupted or destroyed. There's no energy, internet, or food. How do you survive in a world without Walmart's, Taco Bell's, and grocery stores? You might be tempted to grab a gun, flee the city, and live on a homestead in the Sierras: grow your own food, chop your own wood, raise some chickens and sheep... But living in the city are all the food resources you need to survive the apocalypse... In this blog post I'm going to introduce all the edible plants you can find hiding in plain sight on the streets of San Francisco.


### Indian Strawberry

*Potentilla indica*

Arguello Blvd, The Presidio

![Indian strawberry]({{ site.url }}/img/indian_strawberry.jpeg)

Indian strawberries -- or mock strawberries -- are small viney plants with crenate leaves and fruits that look like immature strawberries. If you've walked around the parks in San Francisco, you've likely seen them on the borders of paths or tucked around the trunks of light-exposed trees. These fruits are entirely edible, but not the best tasting: they're bland and a little dry. Some people enjoy the taste. They can be made into jams and sweetened with sugar.

### Lillypilly

*Syzygium smithii*

Near the DeYoung Museum, Golden Gate Park

![Lillypilly]({{ site.url }}/img/lillypilly.jpeg)

I found a lillypilly tree while walking on the paths near the DeYoung Museum in Golden Gate Park. The large clumps of pink berries were eye-catching: they look like a girly take on a Greek Bacchanal. The berries are tart and only mildly sweet: I enjoyed sucking their juice and spitting out the pulp.

*Syzygium paniculatum* is another species of lillypilly that I discovered while walking around the Mission district. I didn't eat the fruits, but looked juicier and more palatable than their pinker relatives.

### Nasturtium

*Tropaeolum majus*

Montezuma and Aztec St

![Nasturtium]({{ site.url }}/img/nasturtium.jpeg)

Nasturtium is probably the most common flowering plant you'll see in San Francisco. The large orange or red flowers -- along with the rest of the plant -- are edible, and can be added to a salad or stir fried. If harvested later in the day or after the plant has matured sufficiently, the plant can taste bitter: so harvest ir early in the morning.

### Fennel

*Foeniculum vulgare*

Near the Bernal Boulder, Bernal Heights

![Fennel]({{ site.url }}/img/fennel.jpeg)

Fennel is common by roadsides and often pushes its way through clumps of other plants in its search for sunlight. The entire plant is edible: the thin, tendril-like leaves can be thrown onto a sandwich or salad or dried out and used as seasoning; the bulb can be sliced and stir-fried. The entire plant has a strong licorice smell, but this is reduced or eliminated by cooking. Fennel is probably one of the most under-appreciated plants on this list -- it has a nice taste, is easy to cook, and goes well in soups, salads, or even on its own.








### Acorns

Genus *Quercus*

LOCATION

![acorns]({{ site.url }}/img/acorns.png)

The oaks are a large genus of trees that produce acorns. These trees all look familiar and I've found that it's very difficult to tell apart different species, so I don't even try. All acorns are edible, though some are tastier than others. Acorns must be processed before eating: they have to be shelled, ground up, and boiled in multiple changes of water to remove bitten tanins. The indigenous [Ohlone people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohlone) of the SF Bay Area ate acorns as one of their primary food sources. Now the only ethnic group that regularly eats acorns are Koreans, usually in the form of acorn jelly. However, a small Korean-owned [bakery in Martinez](https://goo.gl/maps/YuLesgc5qqyq8pLt7) sells acorn flour-based pastries, though I recommend baking your own sugar-free acorn bread (it's delicious).

I've found acorn trees all over San Francisco and have harvested acorns in the fall. However, be warned: most acorns are infested with acorn weevils and they need to be removed before eating.

### Sorrel

*Rumex acetosa*

Montezuma St

![sorrel]({{ site.url }}/img/sorrel.png)

Sorrel is a small and non-descript plant with arrow-shaped leaves. The leaves have a sour, lemony taste that taste nice in salads or as a more astringent substitute for lemons. I like to slice them up and put it on sandwiches and paninis. The sour taste comes from oxalic acid, which is poisonous. However, like many other naturally-occuring poisons, it's completely safe in small quantities (even broccoli is poisonous: children dislike the taste because they are more sensitive to the vegetable's bitter alkaloids). I found sorrel growing in my backyard, which is why I've omitted the specific location.

### Strawberry Tree

*Arbutus Unedo*

LOCATION

![strawberry tree]({{ site.url }}/img/strawberry_tree.png)

Strawberry trees, which are often just called *madrones*, are common roadside trees in West Coast cities. There's one on almost every single city block in San Francisco, though they seem to be more common in less-dense areas. They have a mild, strawberry-like taste and a woody, slightly dry texture. Strawberry tree berries (confusing name, right?) can be rinsed and eaten, though their window of edibility seems to be particularly narrow. I've [written about them](https://camtsmith.com/articles/2016-08/strawberry-trees) before.

### Armenian Blackberry

*Rubus armeniacus*

Folsom St Parking Lot, Bernal Heights

![blackberries]({{ site.url }}/img/blackberries.png)

There are many species of blackberry, but the one most common in San Francisco is the *Armenian Blackberry*. An invasive species, they've taken over large tracts of hillside and now (along with English Ivy) constitute a large portion of the city's forest undergrowth. Blackberries can be eaten raw, but in my experience the window of opportunity between them being too immature and sour and too old and mushy is very narrow, so I prefer to pick the berries and cook them into a jam (recipe: add mushed berries and sugar to a pot of water, boil until nice and thick. Store in mason jars). I've found blackberries in most wooded parks in the city, along with places like Bernal Heights.

### Miner's Lettuce

*Claytonia perfoliata*

LOCATION

![miner's lettuce]({{ site.url }}/img/miners_lettuce.png)

One of the few non-invasive species on the list, this small lily-pad shaped plant was eaten by miners who relocated to California during the gold rush. It has an unusually fleshy texture and tastes great in salads. I like to use it as a wrap to eat cheese. It also tastes great with nasturtium, sorrel, and fennel. This plant may have accumulated oxalate toxins if it's harvested from the wild, so if you'd like be extra cautious, don't eat it for every meale very day.

### Others

There were many other plants that I decided not to include on this list. Some of them include tree mallow, vetch, toyon, cowparsnip, Italian thistle, cat's eat, horsetails, and dock. But there are two plants that deserve honorable mentions: wild radish and wild mustard; the former has an edible root and the latter edible leaves: they look very similar and are easy to confuse.
