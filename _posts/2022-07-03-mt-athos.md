## The Holy Mountain

<i>
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name;
thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread;
and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us;
and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
</i>

## Saint George the Zograf Monastery







Before:
    email monasteries  // directory of of monastery email addresses (LINK)
    double booking
    say we're orthodox christians
    learn the lord's prayer, how to cross myself, a few greek phrases
    Although a part of Greece, it's not inside the European Union. This 

    X fly into sofia and explore city a bit
    X get car and head out to Buzludzha
    x night in Plovdiv, then another night stuck a the border

day 1:
    early morning arrival in Ournapoli
    nap in airbnb, shower, get permits, get covid test, get boat ticket
    /// When we arrived at the Pilgrimage Office (XXX link) we were asked to declare our religion and pay 20 euros. We weren't asked to prove our Orthodoxy, which was convenient because in my fatigued mental state I wouldn't have been able to recite my first and last name, much less the Lord's Prayer. Outside we took a covid test, bought ferry tickets, and waited for our journey into the unknown. ///
    embark!
    empty dock, confusing signs head into forest, get a little lost, monastery appears
    ///  Ζωγράφου (Zografou), the first monastery on our list. Even though it was only 9:00am, the day was hot. Luckily, the path was shaded. Exhausted, already sweating, we walked into the forest and began our journey. ///
    empty courtyard, rest in the heat, monks cloaks in [central church thing], monk walks past, ignoring us
    /// the skeleton of a rusted out car filled with grass. Eventually a cobblestone road led us through a particularly dense area of forest. When the trees opened up we were suddenly at the foot of Zografou monastery. It rose into the sky like a castle - a dozen stories tall. Turrets, walls, and even a strong wooden gateway in front. We passed through the gates and entered into a large courtyard. Clinging to the walls on every side of us were smaller wooden and stone buildings, barnacle-line, and in the center of the courtyard was a larger structure that looked like a church. Inside we found the black monk cloaks hanging from the walls, but the owners were nowhere to be found. 
    
    We rested in the shade and after a few minutes we saw a couple of monks cross through the courtyard, paying us no attention. Eventually a monk walked past us, but didn't even look up to meet our gaze. Feeling like we might be in the wrong place, we grabbed our bags and left the courtyard. Outside we found a wooden building that resembled a stable and a monk who was sawing wood walked out and greeted us. He brought us to another, newer building where we met the leaders of the monastery and were given a cursory orientation. A couple Turkish delights and shots of moonshine later, we were escorted to our room where we tried to stay awake until sunset.
    ///
    we wander around, guy in woodshop waves at us, brings us to pilgrim building
    immediately offered a shot of moonshine, diamonitron gets checked, turkish delight, nap in room, pleasant rain shower, awkwardly follow monk to dinner, prayer/wine early night

day 2:
    leave before seeing anyone, get lost in the forest, [ ] see bay in front of us, hitchhike through olive groves, find monastery, follow beautiful roads to [main town], little streams, springs we drink from, shrines
    buy supplies, eat cherries, drink from public well, observe monks
    leave town, bakery, map is NOT working, nobody on roads, find bridge in forest
    huge castle monastery appears before us, steal food from kitchen, postcards from library, walk around castle grounds, dinner in huge hall, wash clothes in bathroom thing

day 3:
    miss the early bus, get lost in forest, eason insists on taking shitty paths (oops)
    find a spring near a house, forest monk finds us and silently offers food and chocolate
    map sucks, we miss our monastery, see Athos in the distance, walk further and see a different monastery far below us, use the drone for scoutin, take wrong road, exhausted, backtrack, get picked up by monks, they allow us to stay
    monastery is greek, stand through painful religious service, we meet leader, tells us stories of the saints, friendly and curious


day 4:
    wake up early and head to dock
    take boat back to Ouranopoli
    get our car and drive to Thessaloniki
