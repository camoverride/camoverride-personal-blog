Athos is a skinny finger of land that protrudes 40 kilometers into the Ionian Sea. A spine of mountains run the length of the peninsula, covered by dense, ancient forest and terminating in the holy mountain itself, Mt Athos. Clinging to the sides of cliffs and nestled in hidden valleys are many important Christian religious sites. A tangled network of footpaths connect monasteries, shrines, and orchards of fruit-bearing trees where monks grow olives, cherries, apricots, and other foods required for a simple monastic life. These simple footpaths, often poorly mapped, are traversed by pilgrims, monks, and wild animals - Athos is one of the few places in Europe where wolves can still be spotted. Things have changed little since the time of the Byzantine Empire.

Although a part of Greece, Athos is an autonomous region. This loophole allows the religious authorities who govern the peninsula to bar entry to women, as they might distract the monks from the worship of God. Most visitors are also restricted - each day only 100 Orthodox visitors are permitted to enter the peninsula, along with 10 people of other faiths. However, booking a stay is not a simple task: few of the monasteries have an online presence, and cloistered monks are not known for reliably responding to emails.

In this article I'll describe my pilgrimage to the Holy Mountain and introduce it to a non-Orthodox and non-Greek audience.


## Saint George the Zograf Monastery

<i>
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name
thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us
and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil
</i>

The process for entering Athos is best described as *Byzantine*. Monks are not known for their online presence, and the information that does exist is mostly oriented towards Greek- and Russian-speaking visitors. I discovered that monasteries must be [contacted individually](https://www.athonian.gr/transport/mount-athos-telephone-directory/) and reservations made for three consecutive nights. After reservations are confirmed, the main pilgrimage office must be informed of the days you plan to visit. A few Google-translated exchanges later you'll be given a distressingly laconic confirmation that you can pick up your visitors permit (diamonitiron) on the day of your arrival.

Ouranopoli is the outside world's gateway to the closed monastic world of Athos. To our pleasant surprise, we found that entry procedures were sloppy and informal. Before arriving in Greece, I'd taken some time to memorize the Lord's Prayer and learn to cross myself in the hope of passing myself off as a Christian if questioned. Fortunately, the staff at the [Pilgrim Office] simply asked what our religion was and collected the E20 fee before pointing us towards the ferry.

All pilgrims follow the precedent set by the Virgin Mary, who, according to Orthodox tradition, first arrived in Athos when her ship was blown off course while on the way to visit Lazarus in Cyprus. Disembarking on Athos, she was amazed by the natural beauty of her surroundings. She blessed the place and from then on all other women were forbidden from entering.

Our ferry embarked under less dramatic circumstances. [ description of pleasant sea water, soft sun, small number of elderly Greek visitors, monk captaining the ship, blue blue blue Ionian water]

The first stop on our itinerary was Saint George the Zograf Monastery. As soon as we'd thrown our bags down onto the coral white pier the ferry pulled away. The port was empty. A tall hollowed-out watch tower, a barracks-like building, the vine-covered skeleton of a truck, a metal barrel surrounded by a halo of grass. Insects buzzed loudly. The ferry vanished into the blue-on-blue horizon. Our destination was somewhere in a valley behind the port, an uncertain distance ahead.  A Wikipedia article had promised "well-signed" trails in Athos. Eason discovered a fallen over sign with Ζωγράφου (Zograf) written on it. I tried to reconstruct which direction it had once pointed. This was our first inkling that things would be trickier than promised.

Although still only 9:00am, the day was hot. Fortunately, a canopy of oak and cypress trees stretched over the path ahead. Already sweating, we picked up our bags and set off on the dirt path. We made a couple of wrong turns, but eventually found a cobblestone path that led uphill.

When the trees opened up we were suddenly at the foot of Zografou monastery. It rose into the sky like a castle - a dozen stories tall. Turrets, walls, and even a strong wooden gateway in front, more than capable of preventing a seige. We passed through the gates and entered into a large courtyard. Clinging to the walls on every side of us were smaller wooden and stone buildings, barnacle-line, and in the center of the courtyard was a larger structure that looked like a church. Inside we found the black monk cloaks hanging from the walls, but the owners were nowhere to be found.

We'd later discover that every monastery in Athos has a structure similar to this: a central church, a dining hall directly opposite, monk's quarters carved out of the walls.

We threw our bags down and rested in the shade. I peeled off my shoes and massaged by sore feet. A monk crossed the courtyard, dressed in long black robes, paying us no attention. A little while later another passed by. We began to wonder if visitors from the 21st century were invisible here, incongruous as we were. Feeling like we might be in the wrong place, we grabbed our bags and left the courtyard. Outside we found a wooden building that resembled a stable and a monk who was sawing wood walked out and greeted us. He brought us to another, newer building where we met the leaders of the monastery.

An energetic older monk insisted that we have a drink with him. He had bright blue eyes and studied us like we were alien visitors, which perhaps we were. After drowning a few glasses of moonshine, we were asked to produce our diamonitrions and were shown to our room.

There was a pleasant rain shower. I'd decided to forgo technology during my pilgrimage, so I took out the paper book I'd brought with me and started reading. After the rain stopped, I found the blue-eyed monk and with a confusing combination of Greek and English was led to understand that dinner would be served shortly.

Dinners in Athos follow a similar template. The monks enter the central church to pray. When the prayers end, they rush to the dining hall and sit in silence. Plates of food are placed before them and a passage is read from the bible. The food is simple: olives, grapes, bread, clear soup - all things the monks have made or harvested themselves. There's no menu. You eat whatever is placed in front of you. Dinner is eaten in silence. A monk will walk around with a pitcher of wine. If you want some, you simply lift your glass. When the bible passage ends, the book is slammed shut loudly. The forks are all dropped. Everyone stands up, chewing their final mouthful and leave as quickly as they entered. Mt Athos is intended to be a place where attention is directed towards God, not earthly pleasures like food.

The monks perform another prayer after dinner. But as pilgrims, we were excused from this ritual. Exhausted from our early morning and difficult trip overland from Bulgaria, we returned to the simple sleeping quarters and passed out before sunset.
