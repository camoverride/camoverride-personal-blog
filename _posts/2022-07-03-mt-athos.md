Mt Athos is a mountainous peninsula in Northern Greece that extends XXX kilometers into the Ionian Sea. Also called the "Holy Mountain," it's the home to numerous Orthodox Christian monasteries, hermitages, and shrines. Women are banned, and few visitors apart from pilgrims are permitted to enter. The first monasteries were built here during the Byzantine Era and little seems to have changed in the last thousand years: the peninsula's castle-like monasteries, cobble stone footpaths, and terraced olive orchards feel medieval.

Eason and I wanted to visit, so in July we bought tickets to Sofia in nearby Bulgaria. The plan was to rent a car and cross the border into Greece, where we'd go to the small town of Ouranopoli where all pilgrims entering Athos pass through. But things didn't go according to plan.


## Stopped at the Border

Initially, all was well. We visited the Buzludzha. It's the abandoned headquarters of the Bulgarian Communist party, and looms over the surrounding hills and valley like a strange concrete UFO. We passed through a land of gentle rolling hills, yellow cornfields, and old orange-tiled buildings overgrown with grape vines and wisteria. As the sun began setting we arrived at the border, only to realize that our car's registration was missing. We were refused entry into Greece. Stuck. We called up the rental company and they promised to send someone over in three hours with the paperwork. Ten hours later, our driver finally arrived and we crossed into Greece.

I couldn't keep my eyes open so Eason took the wheel. When I woke up I glanced out the window and saw hills and villages spread out in the distance. Even further out was the gentle blue of the Ionian Sea and the bruised purple of the rising sun. We'd been hoping to start the pilgrimage after a night resting in a local hotel, but instead we resed for a few minutes in a parking lot in Ouranopoli before setting out.

It's not possible to just show up at Mt Athos. All visitors to the Holy Mountain require a *diamonitirion*, or pilgrim permit, which grants them access to the peninsula and its monasteries. The only problem is that getting a diamonitirion is a rather *Byzantine* process.


## Ouranopoli

Permits are only issued in-person and the number of permits given out per day is capped at 100 -- and just ten of those are given to non-Orthodox Christians. In addition to banning women, the authorities frown upon anything too rowdy or secular. Athos is a place of inward refelction on the divine. Not wanting to take any risks, we decided it would be best if we pretended that we were Orthodox and started practicing religious rituals and memorizing the Lord's Prayer:

<i>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name;
thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread;
and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us;
and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.</i>

Additionally, bookings with monasteries are required for each night of the stay. The problem with this is that monks mostly eschew modern advancements like phones and computers, so getting in touch with a monastery isn't easy -- it's not like they're on AirBNB. Fortunately, after a lot of internet searches in the previous weeks, I'd found a directory of of monastery email addresses (LINK) and started sending out messages. After waiting for what felt like an eternity I was able to confirm some bookings.

When we arrived at the Pilgrimage Office (XXX link) we were asked to declare our religion and pay 20 euros. We weren't asked to prove our Orthodoxy, which was convenient because in my fatigued mental state I wouldn't have been able to recite my first and last name, much less the Lord's Prayer. Outside we took a covid test, bought ferry tickets, and waited for our journey into the unknown.

Athos is a medieval place, disconnected from the rest of the world. Time stands still here. We'd decided to fully embrace the experience by disabling our phones for the entirely of the trip. Eason still had a digital camera, but before the ferry departed we turned off our phones and hid them in Eason's backpack.

The ferry was mostly empty - the captain, a couple monks, and some old Greek men with large bellies who looked *very* religious. The ferry plodded slowly through the clear blue sea. To our left was the green mountainous spine of Athos. We speculated that the brown and gray smudges we saw on the mountainsides were terraced olive orchards and vinyards. Apart from a couple tiny docks, there were few buildings.

After almost an hour, the boat began approaching shore. A couple stone watchtowers and a barracks were clustered around an ancient pier made from yellow white stone that looked like chalk. We were the only ones to depart. I waved a goodbye to the captain and we walked into the abandoned port. There were signs of recent human habitation - tire tracks, a clothesline, and a rusted bicycle - but no people. The buildings were overgrown with vines and creepers, an uncertain middle-ground between abandonment and habitation. We'd soon learn that much of Athos was like this: as the monks are divided between their devotion to God and the worldly requirements of life, the place has the strange quality of feeling built-up then suddenly forgotten.

At the back of the port settlement, we found a sign pointing up into the hills. It said XXX (YYY in Greek), the first monastery on our list. Even though it was only 9:00am, the day was hot. Luckily, the path was shaded. Exhausted, already sweating, we walked into the forest and began our journey.


## Monastery 1

We got lost a couple times on our way to XXX. We saw a few signs of human settlement: a couple small clearings with crops growing, and a shrine. Eventually a cobblestone road led us through a particularly dense area of forest. When the trees opened up we were suddenly at the foot of XXX monastery. It rose into the sky like a castle - a dozen stories tall. Turrets, walls, and even a strong wooden gateway in front. We passed through the gates and entered into a large courtyard. Clinging to the walls on every side of us were smaller wooden and stone buildings, and in the center of the courtyard was a larger structure that looked like a church. Inside we found the black monk cloaks hanging from the walls, but the owners were nowhere to be found.

We rested in the shade and after a few minutes we saw a couple of monks cross through the courtyard, paying us no attention. Eventually a monk walked past us, but didn't even look up to meet our gaze. Feeling like we might be in the wrong place, we grabbed our bags and left the courtyard. We found a wooden building that resembled a stable and a monk who was sawing wood walked out and greeted us. He brought us to another, newer building where we met the leaders of the monastery and were given a cursory orientation.
