Mt Athos is a place where tourists rarely visit, which is why Eason and I found it extremely appealing. A rugged peninsula that pokes into the Ionian Sea, Athos is a place of pilgrimage for Orthodox Christians. Dense, primeival forest covers the peninsula and little footpaths connect the many castle-like monasteries. Usually only devout Orthodox Christians visit, but we wanted to see what all the fuss was about.

We decided to visit in July and bought tickets to Sofia, the capital of nearby Bulgaria. The plan was to get a car and drive south into the small town of XXXXX in Northern Greece. XXXXX is the gateway to Athos, where visitors pick up their *diamonitirion* (pilgrimage permits) and then take a ferry from there to Athos. The only problem is that getting
a diamonitirion is a rather Byzantine process.

Permits are only issued in-person and the number of permits given out per day is capped at 100 -- and just ten of those are given to non-Orthodox Christians. Not wanting to take any risks, we decided it would be best if we pretended that we were Orthodox and started practicing religious rituals and memorizing the Lord's Prayer:

<i>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name;
thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread;
and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us;
and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.</i>

Additionally, bookings with monasteries are required for each night of the stay. The problem with this is that monks mostly eschew modern advancements like phones and computers, so getting in touch with a monastery is not exactly easy -- it's not like they're on AirBNB. After many fruitless internet searches, I finally found a directory of monastery email addresses (LINK) and started sending out messages. After waiting what felt like an eternity for someone thoroughally enmeshed in the 21st century, I was able to confirm some bookings. The only piece of the puzzle left was showing up in XXXXX and getting our diamonitirions.
