In 2016 I hitchhiked from Sulaymaniyah in Iraqi Kurdistan to the ancient town of Hasankeyf in Turkey ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/tFcn4C9X4iRtUgTz9)). Hasankeyf now rests on the bottom of a lake - submerged in 2020 after the completion of the IlÄ±su dam. When I first jotted down the notes that would become this story I never imagined that the ancient valley full of austere minarets, [Turkman bridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Bridge,_Hasankeyf), crumbling caravanserai's, and stone houses stacked one on top of another would be wiped from the face of the earth.

But maybe it makes more sense than that - as I try to recall the memories and stitch these notes together, I realize that some parts are submerged. I went through all the pictures on my phone, the text messages I sent, and the things I jotted down in my notebook and on scraps of paper in order to assemble this narrative - but there are still some holes in the story: When did I learn about Lalish and the peacock angel? How did I get to the Tigris, my feet in the freezing water? Maybe I'll never get all the details straight or in the right order, but I'll start with the first thing that comes to mind - the war:

The Islamic State ([ISIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant)) was born in the deserts of Western Iraq, where fighters driving [technicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_(vehicle)) overran cities and proclaimed a new caliphate. ISIL militants massacred Shia's, [Yazidi's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinjar_massacre), and any Sunni Muslims they viewed as heretics. The Islamic State quickly metastisized, following the path of the Euphrates all the way to the gates of Baghdad in the East while also threatening Damascus in the West. This part of the world had been torn apart by the Syrian and Iraqi civil wars - cities depopulated, factories abandoned, fields of bones, the desert coming to reclaim farms, wash over highways... This region had barely begun to recover before being overwhelmed by a new enemy.

In the East, Syrian forces with Russian military support managed to keep ISIL away from the densely populated Mediterranean coast, even as it gobbled up a third of the nation. In the North, the world watched as Kurdish forces in Rojava repelled the Islamic during a protracted siege - the Stalingrad of the Syrian Civil War - even though later the Turks would betray their erstwhile allies as the city was bargained off to Assad and Putin. Out of the chaos a new proto-state, Rojava, would be born - an experiment in libertarian socialism in the Kurdish heartland.

While this was happening in the North and East, the Islamic state was fighting American and Iraqi forces on the outskirts of Baghdad. The tide was beginning to turn in favor of the Kurds: the Kurish security forces (_Peshmerga_) were launching [a campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kirkuk_(2016)) to liberate Kirkuk - sometimes called "the heart of Kurdistan" - from ISIL. The TV stations had 24-hour coverage of the fight: Peshmerga soldiers rushing to the front lines, machine gun fire kicking up clouds of dust, shaky images of mortar shells obliterating neighborhoods, the bodies of heroic Kurdish martyrs being pulled from the rubble...

I decided that I needed to revisit these old notes in order to take account of everything I experienced in this chaotic part of the world - to attach myself to history instead of letting it pass my by. Without some kind of narrative, these memories are just disconnected fragments that can whither away and melt like icicles in the sun. The war is the backdrop, the setting, and I was lucky enough to only experience it indirectly - but I'm still entangled. Where I enter the story is at Sulaymaniyeh International Airport in Iraqi Kurdistan.


## Slemani

Sulaymaniyeh (Ø§Ù„Ø³Ù„ÙŠÙ…Ø§Ù†ÙŠØ© - reduced to _Slemani_ by the locals) is one of the largest cities in the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq. Americans need a visa to enter Iraq, but __not__ Kurdistan - a nation inside of a nation. Americans are viewed positively here - after all, it was George W Bush who killed Saddam, a great [enemy of the Kurds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfal_genocide), and whose father, George H W Bush, is credited with [protecting the Kurds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_no-fly_zones_conflict) during the first Gulf War by establishing a no-fly zone. _America, great!_ the border security official said as he did a cursory inspection of our passports and stamped them.

Outside the airport, I immediately noticed the overwhelming smell of diesel - with a power grid prone to failure and sabotage, many homes and businesses run their own generators, powered by petrol that's only slightly more expensive than bottled water. A brownish smog hung over valley, blending in with the hills on the horizon. As we walked from the airport towards the city center, a driver was kind enough to pull over and give us our first ride.

We found a hotel and dropped off our bags before setting out to explore. The city was beautiful, complicated. Small parks and gardens overflowed with pomegranates and daffodils. Ancient mosques were sandwiched between new mid-rise apartment buildings. Armed convoys patrolled the streets, men with guns walking right past revolutionary graffiti - _PKK_ _Peshmerga_ _Ã–calan_.

There's a hill in the middle of the city that overlooks everything - sort of like the acropolis in Athens. Perched on top of it is the _Grand Millenium Hotel and shopping mall_ which we visited to get a view of the valley. The building was mostly abandoned - just a skeleton crew of guards and cleaners to keep the place from being robbed or falling into decay. This weird kind of abandonment - upscale infrastructure build for an upper class that doesn't yet exist - would be repeated in different forms in other places in Iraq.

From the Grand Millenium we descended into the old city, where the grid yields to chaotic and winding cluster of ancient streets and alleyways. The market (_souq_ in Arabic, borrowed into Kurdish) was packed with activity of every kind: street vendors selling watches, kids chasing soccer balls, old men perched under umbrellas playing cards or smoking hookahs.

The lack of women on the streets was very obvious: it was __men__ playing cards, __men__ buying toilet paper, and __men__ shooting friendly smiles and greetings at us. Many of the older men wore the traditional Kurdish outfit: baggy Alladin pants, a shirt of the same color, a sash around the waist so that it looks like the outfit is one piece (not two), a vest, a keffiyah tied around their head, and a blue or white undershirt.

Food in Iraqi Kurdistan is cheap and delicious. Bakeries, tea houses, and small shops are wedged between apartment buildings. These bakers were enthusiastic about getting their picture taken.

## The Tomb of Cyaxares

- road to Kirkuk
- staying with family
Qizqapan is rumored to be the tomb of Median King Cyaxares. Cyaxares' forces clashed with the Lydians in the battle of Halys. During the battle, an eclipse occurred. Interpreting this as an omen, the opposing sides agreed to stop the bloodshed. Because it occurred during [The Eclipse of Thales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_of_Thales), this battle is the oldest historical event that is known to the exact day. The Ionian columns that flank the tomb's entrance predate any Ionian columns in Greece, which has led some historians to conclude that this architectural style was invented first by the Medians. Also, in contrast to its standard depiction, the [Faravahar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faravahar) symbol left of the tomb's entrance has wings that curl upwards. I'm not sure why someone spray-painted **Ù†Ø§ØªÛ†** (NATO) all over the tomb's facade.

Yazidis believe that god created the world by casting a white pearl into the cosmic ocean. As it sunk into the depths, the pearl shattered, becoming the substance from which the material universe would be formed. To assist in his work, god created the Peacock Angel, Tawsi Melek. Six more angels were fashioned by god to assist Tawsi Melek, greatest of the angels, in his creation of the world.

After the earth was created it began shaking uncontrollably. Tawsi Melek descended from heaven in the form of a peacock and stopped the shaking. He then transferred the rainbow colors of his plumage to the earth, filling it with flora and fauna. The place that Tawsi Melek descended to is Lalish, the mountain holy to the Yazidis.

I visited Lalish to learn more about the Yazidi religion. In a narrow valley that meanders towards the crest of the short mountain are clustered many of this religion's holiest sites. There are graves, shrines, and strange minaret-like structures. Many of these have symbols carved into their surfaces.

While I wandered through Lalish I asked locals about the meanings of the symbols. While some have obvious meanings (the Peacock in the last image is Tawsi Melek), many were more mysterious. Below are photographs along with speculations about their possible meanings.


An animal tied by the neck, which might indicate that it is being given as an offering.

A twelve-petaled flower that resembles chamomile.

A five-petaled flower that resembles a cinquefoil. However, cinquefoils are not native to West Asia.

The peacock in the pediment above the door is Tawsi Melek. To the right of the door is a black snake. This might have once been a living snake that had attacked the residents of Lalish. It might also be the physical manifestation of one of the seven angels.

## Duhok


## Silopi


## Cizre

- almost in Syria

## Mor Gabriel

Mor Gabriel was founded in the fourth century, making it the oldest Syriac Orthodox monastery in the world. While exploring the monastary, I came across [Mor Timotheos Samuel Aktas](http://www.syriacchristianity.info/bio/SyriacOrthodox/bio_TimotheosAktas.htm), archbishop of the Tur Abdin diocese. His secretary served me tea and we talked about Syriac Christian culture and the strained relationship between Assyrians and their Turkish neighbors. Much like the Armenians, Assyrians are seeking international recognition for a genocide committed against their people by the Turkish government in the early 20th century.
