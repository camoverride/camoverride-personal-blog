I hitchhiked from Sulaymaniyah in Iraqi Kurdistan to Silopi in Turkish Kurdistan ([map path](https://goo.gl/maps/4NqWW3NxJ9D8hr7a9). This was a chaotic time to visit Iraq: the Kurish security forces (Peshmerga) were launching a campaign to liberate Kirkuk from ISIS. The TV stations had 24-coverage of the fight, Peshmerga rushing to the front lines, light machine gun fire kicking up clouds of dust, shaky images of mortar shells oblitherating neighborhoods, the bodies of heroic Kurdish martyrs being pulled from the rubble.

Despite this, I found the people to be warm, friendly, and enthusiastic connoisseurs of American culture.

Below are some pictures that I took along the way.

#### Bazaar

This is the main market in Sulaymaniyah, cultural capital of Iraqi Kurdistan. Sulaymaniyah's suburbs sprawl into the brown naked hills that ring the city. Because of its location in a valley, the city is shrouded in thick smog before the afternoon winds arrive. After the smog dissipates, the market becomes populated.

#### Bakery

Food in Iraqi Kurdistan is cheap and delicious. Bakeries, tea houses, and small shops are wedged between apartment buildings. These bakers were enthusiastic about getting their picture taken.

#### Qizqapan

Qizqapan is rumored to be the tomb of Median King Cyaxares. Cyaxares' forces clashed with the Lydians in the battle of Halys. During the battle, an eclipse occurred. Interpreting this as an omen, the opposing sides agreed to stop the bloodshed. Because it occurred during [The Eclipse of Thales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_of_Thales), this battle is the oldest historical event that is known to the exact day. The Ionian columns that flank the tomb's entrance predate any Ionian columns in Greece, which has led some historians to conclude that this architectural style was invented first by the Medians. Also, in contrast to its standard depiction, the [Faravahar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faravahar) symbol left of the tomb's entrance has wings that curl upwards. I'm not sure why someone spray-painted **Ù†Ø§ØªÛ†** (NATO) all over the tomb's facade.

#### Checkpoints

Peshmerga soldiers control the roads, making Iraqi Kurdistan an island of stability in a war-torn region. Many Kurds are fond of the Bush administration for ending the regime of Saddam Hussein -- although the invasion has caused the rest of Iraq to descend into chaos, Kurdistan was able to free itself from the weakened central government and flourish independently.

#### Mor Gabriel

Mor Gabriel was founded in the fourth century, making it the oldest Syriac Orthodox monastery in the world. While exploring the monastary, I came across [Mor Timotheos Samuel Aktas](http://www.syriacchristianity.info/bio/SyriacOrthodox/bio_TimotheosAktas.htm), archbishop of the Tur Abdin diocese. His secretary served me tea and we talked about Syriac Christian culture and the strained relationship between Assyrians and their Turkish neighbors. Much like the Armenians, Assyrians are seeking international recognition for a genocide committed against their people by the Turkish government in the early 20th century.

##### Another Sulaymaniyah Market Scene

Yazidis believe that god created the world by casting a white pearl into the cosmic ocean. As it sunk into the depths, the pearl shattered, becoming the substance from which the material universe would be formed. To assist in his work, god created the Peacock Angel, Tawsi Melek. Six more angels were fashioned by god to assist Tawsi Melek, greatest of the angels, in his creation of the world.

After the earth was created it began shaking uncontrollably. Tawsi Melek descended from heaven in the form of a peacock and stopped the shaking. He then transferred the rainbow colors of his plumage to the earth, filling it with flora and fauna. The place that Tawsi Melek descended to is Lalish, the mountain holy to the Yazidis.

I visited Lalish to learn more about the Yazidi religion. In a narrow valley that meanders towards the crest of the short mountain are clustered many of this religion's holiest sites. There are graves, shrines, and strange minaret-like structures. Many of these have symbols carved into their surfaces.

While I wandered through Lalish I asked locals about the meanings of the symbols. While some have obvious meanings (the Peacock in the last image is Tawsi Melek), many were more mysterious. Below are photographs along with speculations about their possible meanings.

#### Animal

An animal tied by the neck, which might indicate that it is being given as an offering.

#### Chamomile

A twelve-petaled flower that resembles chamomile.

#### Cinquefoil

A five-petaled flower that resembles a cinquefoil. However, cinquefoils are not native to West Asia.

#### Kissing Animals

#### A Place for Burning Oil

#### Tomb of Sheikh Adi

The peacock in the pediment above the door is Tawsi Melek. To the right of the door is a black snake. This might have once been a living snake that had attacked the residents of Lalish. It might also be the physical manifestation of one of the seven angels.
