title: About me 
---

Welcome to my blog ðŸ’–

I've written about some of my hobbies: traveling, languages, and food - mostly from an autobiographical perspective.

If you want to hop on a short zoom call, just [schedule a meeting](https://calendly.com/camoverride/chitchat) - I talk to strangers from all over the world and enjoy it!

Other ways to get in touch are: sending me a message on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/camoverride/) or an email: <a href="camoverride@gmail.com">camoverride@gmail.com</a>. I respond to all the messages I get, even if you're a stranger or live on the opposite side of the world ðŸŒŽ
